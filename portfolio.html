			<h3>Websites & Wireframes</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt><p><em>Knit Matters</em></p></dt>
					<dd><p>A mid-fi to hi-fi website wireframe for <i>Knit Matters</i>, which I intend to be a central space to collect details of knitting and crochet appeals across the UK.</p></dd>
					<dd><p>Knitting appeals are appeals for custom knitted or crocheted clothing, blankets, accessories or other materials, sent in by volunteer knitters. Often, these items will be sent to the people that need them directly, or they may be sold or auctioned to fundraise. Neo-natal wards are often in need of hats, blankets and other baby items in premature sizes, for example, and often rely on item donations in this way.</p></dd>
					<dd><p>However, individual hospitals and charities will have their own requirements for items and their specifications.  These can often be very specialised. Information about knitting appeals is spread out on static websites that aren't updated frequently, and where information can be found, it is limited and does not provide an entry point into creating items for charity appeals.</p></dd>
					<dd><p>My website, <i>Knit Matters</i>, would not only collect and display up-to-date information on appeals across the country, navigable by location, but also provide guidance on how to get started, including advice on which materials are best and links to patterns which can be used.</p></dd>
					<dd><p>My wireframe includes five pages: a welcome page with general guidance on getting started, a page to sort through appeals, a page for patterns and recommendations for materials, an about page and a blog page, as well as pop-ups to highlight urgent appeals and request donations. I have implemented a sticky navigation bar, links within pages, an interactive image carousel, and a dropdown menu.</p></dd>

					<dt>Campaigns for Volunteering Matters</dt>
						<dd><p>I designed, researched and scheduled three individual social media campaigns for Volunteering Matters Wales & South West in 2020.</p></dd>
						<dd><p>I ran three campaigns using materials designed on Canva and with Microsoft Office, posting the materials on FaceBook. Across the board, my campaigns were the amongst the most-viewed and earned the highest levels of interaction across the organisation's FaceBook page.</p></dd>
